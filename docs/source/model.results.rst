Model Performance Results
=========================

In this project, there are two metrics used to evaluate the model:

1. Exact-matching (Logical-form) Accuracy: 
The percentage of the predicted queries having the exact match with the ground truth queries.

2. Execution Accuracy: 
The percentage of the predicted queries, when executed, result in the correct result.

The trained model performance is summarized in the table below.
